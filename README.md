Bar Chart - Visualizes the distribution of gender (a categorical variable).
Histogram - Visualizes the distribution of age (a continuous variable).
The project includes two parts:

Displays the result in a bar chart.
Age Distribution (Histogram):

Plots a histogram to show the frequency of different age ranges in the dataset.
